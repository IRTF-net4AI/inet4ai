  Generative AI systems are approaching a scalability limit in their development. 
  Due to power density issues, it will soon become infeasible to train large 
  language models with an increasing number of parameters in a single datacenter. 
  While the industry is actively pursuing an effort to scale up AI systems, it 
  becomes necessary to explore the use of scaled-out, global distributed systems 
  to train or serve generative AI models. 

  Besides, services based on generative AI ask for stringent quality of service 
  levels to meet users demand. Meeting those requirements can be addressed by 
  using systems mixing powerful computing instances residing in cloud platforms 
  with localized edge platforms, using heterogeneous and distributed systems.

  Those questions may find a solution in approaches adopted by  federated 
  learning systems, in which models are trained among several stakeholders. Yet, 
  those systems also face scalability issues in dealing with models of a larger 
  size. 

  This workshop, initiated in the realm of the Internet Research Task Force 
  (IRTF), aims at discussing the networking challenges raised by the distribution 
  of generative AI workloads at a large scale. To that extend, we aim at 
  receiving contributions from academic researchers, machine learning system 
  developers or AI infrastructure providers on the following topics:
